-- Patterns Of Type Abstraction

-- In this chapter we look at some of the key advances on one of the major fronts of Haskell's evolution: language extensions.

-- Haskell extensions are tied to the compiler implementation rather than the language standard.
-- We'll explore the extensions along three axes: abstracting functions, datatypes, and type-classes.

-- 1. Abstracting function types: RankNTypes
-- 2. Abstracting datatypes: Existential quantification, phantom types, generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs), type case pattern, dynamic types, and heterogeneous lists.
-- 3. Abstracing type-classes: Multiparameter type-classes and functional dependencies.
